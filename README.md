# Memes-Sentiment-Analysis
This project performs sentiment analysis on memes using a combination of image and text data. It employs deep learning models to analyze both visual and textual elements of memes. The image data is processed using a convolutional neural network (CNN), while the textual data is processed using a recurrent neural network (RNN). The models are combined to provide comprehensive sentiment analysis, including humor, sarcasm, offensiveness, motivation, and overall sentiment. The project utilizes Flask for building a web service to accept meme images, extract text from them, and provide sentiment analysis results.
